In July 1858, London was at boiling point. The smells of untreated waste engulfed the streets. Parliament was halted. Thousands were dying. What could be done? 
     
In 1832, there had been an enormous breakout of cholera throughout England. 30,000 people were
killed by the disease between 1831 and 1832  as it spread its way from Manchester and Liverpool 
throughout the country to create an epidemic. Despite the deadly signs and huge death toll, 
once the disease died down almost nothing was done to help it be prevented again in the future.
Therefore, when a second wave hit the even more crowded and unsanitary country in 1848, there
were 60,000 deaths within another 2-year span . People began to spread rumours and ask questions
as to how this disease could be affecting so many people and with such aggression.

The summer of 1858 was one of the dryest years since records had begun in 1766. As the scorching
sun beat down on the Thames, foul smells began to engulf the city where the waste disposal system 
of cesspits and streams had directly deposited waste into the capitals river. The peak of the
‘stink’ was reached when Parliament was halted from its new location (moved in 1512 to Westminster
palace) due to the smell of human waste from the Thames.  It was considered to move Parliament away
from the river so that it could be continued. This direct issue faced by politicians elevated the
scale of the issue of waste disposal in London from a pauper problem to a real issue impacting the 
upper classes jobs and day to day lives. These were the people with the authority to make change 
and with this issue now causing them problems they decided change was needed. This consequently 
led to the government rushing through a bill, proposed by Benjamin Disraeli, to the Metropolitan 
Board of Works to begin construction on a new and improved sewer system for London and the Thames.
The bill became law in just 18 days !
