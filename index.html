In July 1858, London was at boiling point. The smells of untreated waste engulfed the streets. Parliament was halted. Thousands were dying. What could be done? 
In 1832, there had been an enormous breakout of cholera throughout England. 30,000 people were killed by the disease between 1831 and 1832  as it spread its way from Manchester and Liverpool throughout the country to create an epidemic. Despite the deadly signs
and huge death toll, once the disease died down almost nothing was done to help it be prevented again in the future. Therefore, when a second wave hit the even more crowded and unsanitary country in 1848, there were 60,000 deaths within another 2-year span . People 
began to spread rumours and ask questions as to how this disease could be affecting so many people and with such aggression.
