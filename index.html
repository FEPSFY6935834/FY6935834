In July 1858, London was at boiling point. The smells of untreated waste engulfed the streets. Parliament was halted. Thousands were dying. What could be done? 
     
In 1832, there had been an enormous breakout of cholera throughout England. Almost 15,000 people were
killed by the disease between 1831 and 1832 in London alone as it spread its down the country from
docks in Manchester and Liverpool after returning sailors introduced the deadly disease to England
creating a nationwide epidemic. Despite the deadly signs and huge death toll, once the disease died
down almost nothing was done to help it be prevented again in the future. Therefore, when a second 
wave hit the even more crowded and unsanitary country in 1848, there were 60,000 deaths within another
2-year span . People began to spread rumours and ask questions as to how this disease could be
affecting so many people and with such aggression.

The summer of 1858 was one of the dryest years since records had begun in 1766. As the scorching
sun beat down on the Thames, foul smells began to engulf the city where the waste disposal system 
of cesspits and streams had directly deposited waste into the capitals river. The peak of the
‘stink’ was reached when Parliament was halted from its new location (moved in 1512 to Westminster
palace) due to the smell of human waste from the Thames.  It was considered to move Parliament away
from the river so that it could be continued. This direct issue faced by politicians elevated the
scale of the issue of waste disposal in London from a pauper problem to a real issue impacting the 
upper classes jobs and day to day lives. These were the people with the authority to make change 
and with this issue now causing them problems they decided change was needed. This consequently 
led to the government rushing through a bill, proposed by Benjamin Disraeli, to the Metropolitan 
Board of Works to begin construction on a new and improved sewer system for London and the Thames.
The bill became law in just 18 days !

This led to Joseph Bazalgette (Chief Engineer at the Metropolitan Board of Works) being drafted in to
design the new sewers for London with an offer of £2.5 million  from the government. At the time, the
main belief for the widespread disease and illness within London was the miasma theory  – whereby bad 
smells where the cause for illness and deaths. Therefore, after 137 different proposals , Bazalgette 
came up with a plan of 1100 drains underneath the city, connecting into 82 miles of brick sewers that 
linked into 6 intercepting sewers . These guided the waste to the East of London where it was deposited
into the tidal Thames estuary at high tide so that it would be pulled out into the channel and no longer
sat stagnant. This waste was pumped carried East via the sewers to a system of pumping stations at 
Deptford, Crossness and Abbey Mills. These stations utilised steam powered beam engines. At Crossness,
4 pumps were used. These were constructed by James Watt & Co to Bazalgette’s exact specifications and
named ‘ Victoria’ , ‘Prince Consort’, ‘Albert Edward’ and ‘Alexandra’ after members of the Royal family
at the time. The engines ran at 11 revolutions per minute with 6 tonnes of waste pumped per stroke. The
raw sewage was lifted 40 foot from the sewer into a 27 million gallon (imperial) reservoir where it was
then stored until ebbing tide (just after high tide) where it was then released into the Thames and was
carried away from London by the flow of the estuary as it ran out into the English channel.

To construct the 1100 miles of drain that transported the waste from the home to the main brick sewer,
the base of old rivers that waste was previously carried in were covered over and lined with brick. 
This kept the bad smells of ‘miasma’ that was causing cholera away from the public while utilising some
of the old system without needing to create a huge amount of tunnels from scratch. It was during this 
construction that Bazalgette insisted in the use of Portland cement to hold the 318 million bricks
together. This was a relatively new product and if not mixed correctly would have a hugely reduced
structural strength. In order to make sure that these errors did not occur, Bazalgette inspected every
site with a quality control check making sure that no leaks were present and that the construction was
to his specifications. Amazingly, due to this decision and Bazalgette’s foresight to make the tunnels 
far larger than needed at the time, the sewers are still used to this day – almost 160 years on! It was
only in 2016 that the construction of the new Thames Tideway Tunnel project was started as Bazalgette’s 
system was starting to show signs of modernisation. This shows the longevity and future thinking work 
that Bazalgette put in place for the growth of London into a mega city in the 21st century.

Unfortunately, in 1878 the Princess Alice pleasure boat crashed and sank in the Thames just an hour after
the pumping stations had dumped untreated waste into the river. Many drowned immediately, however those
who survived the water died just days after due to the huge amount of pollution they had consumed from
the river. In total there were 640 deaths from the Princess Alice disaster causing pressure for changes
in his system. Therefore,in 1885 the pumping stations at Crossness and Beckton began work to purify and 
treat the sewage before it was dumped into the Thames  so as to keep it clean even when waste was flushed
in at ebbing tide. The result of this was the complete eradication of cholera and typhoid in London – a
horror which had plagued the city for almost a hundred years. Although he had set out to remove smells 
from the city, he had accidentally discovered and proved that these public health crises were water born.
Therefore, Joseph Bazalgettes creation and opening of his sewer system in 1865, benefitted the public 
health of London to a large extent. By taking waste out the streets, and in turn purify drinking water, 
he removed water born diseases from London life – crucially removing cholera that had caused hundreds of 
thousands of deaths since its first outbreak in 1831. In 2025, the disease is now completely eliminated
in the UK thanks to Bazalgette’s pioneering work and medical breakthrough .
